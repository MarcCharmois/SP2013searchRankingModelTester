Welcome to the SP2013searchRankingModelTester!

This console Application allows you to test a custom Ranking model in order to check if your custom ranking model matches what the user wanted to find, that is to mean : search relevance.
To test custom ranking models you normaly have to reference them in the search display results web part that is very tiring while doing test. With this console application you can easily test several ranking models quickly.
